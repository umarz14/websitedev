This is a small project just to refresh on git.
This is just an additional line. 
hello world
sometimes when merging you have made a lot of commits
in one of the branches you can use the 
flag --squash to make  one commit commpact commits
ex "git merge feature --squash"
note that the commit of the head branch wont change
so youll have to do that on your own
